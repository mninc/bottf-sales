    <p>All trades are successful trades with bot.tf bots. Due to the way this information is collected,
    not all trades may be present. You can click at the top of the trade to see more detail, including participants of
        the trade, paint and unusual effect. This permalink will never be deleted.
        Once a page is full (~100kB or 200 trades) it is deleted off the bottom, but permalinked pages stay.
